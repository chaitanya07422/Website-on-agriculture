            <p>Aqua feed is a crucial element in aquaculture, providing essential nutrition to a diverse range of
                aquatic animals such as fish, shrimp and fish, and prawns. Tailored to each species' nutritional
                requirements, it
                contains vital components like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. The composition
                draws from natural sources like fishmeal, soybean meal, and grains, with pelleted forms being popular
                due to their easy handling. Specialized feeds cater to different growth stages, such as fry and
                broodstock. Sustainability considerations drive research into alternative protein sources, aiming to
                reduce reliance on marine-derived ingredients. Regulated for quality, aqua feed plays a pivotal role in
                the growth, health, and productivity of aquaculture operations, contributing to the ever-evolving field
                of aquatic nutrition.</p>

            <h1>Prawns and fish Feed</h1>
            <p>shrimp and fish feed is one of the important things that must be considered in shrimp and fish farming.
                The
                reason is, each farmer has to spend a lot of money on this feed compared to other pond needs. In
                addition, shrimp and fish feed also plays an important role in the growth of shrimp and fish. If you
                provide
                feed with the right dose and nutrition, shrimp and fish will grow faster, and your cultivation can
                provide optimal results.</p>

            <h2>Types of Shrimp and fish Feed</h2>
            <h3>1.Natural Feed</h3>
            <img src="./images/main_para1.avif" class="img1">
            <p>shrimp and fish natural feed is a type of feed that comes from nature without being processed first. This
                natural food can be phytoplankton and zooplankton which were previously prepared during farm
                preparation, as well as other animals and plants. <br> <br>

                Traditional types of shrimp and fish farms usually rely on this type of natural feed. Meanwhile, in
                semi-intensive, intensive, and super-intensive farms, natural feed is usually used as a companion to the
                artificial feed that has been given.</p>
            <h3>2.Artificial Feed</h3>
            <h4>a.Pellets</h4>
            <img src="./images/main_para2.jpg" class="img1">
            <p>In contrast to natural feed, artificial feed is a type of feed that undergoes a processing process first
                to form pellets, crumble, or powder. Usually, a good artificial shrimp and fish feed has additional
                nutrients to accelerate the growth of shrimp and fish during cultivation. <br>

                Based on the shape, artificial feed is divided into three types, namely pellets, granules (crumbles),
                and powders.</p>

            <h4>b.Granules (Crumble)</h4>
            <img src="./images/main_para2.jpg" class="img1">
            <p>Granules or crumble are shrimp and fish feed in the form of coarse granules. Usually, this type of shrimp
                and fish
                feed is given to shrimp and fish aged 16-45 days.

                Granules can be made from crushed pellets or agglomerated powder feed types. Meanwhile, in terms of
                nutritional content, the type of granule shrimp and fish feed has nutrients that have been adjusted to
                the
                age of the shrimp and fish.</p>

            <h4>c.Powder</h4>
            <img src="./images/main_para2.jpg" class="img1">
            <p>The last type of shrimp and fish feed is powder. This type of feed has a fine grain texture that is
                suitable for shrimp and fish under 16 days of age. Because, at that age, shrimp and fish can only catch
                foods with small
                textures.</p>

                    Crabs Feed
                </h1>
                <img src="./images/feed/crab.webp" alt="">
                <p>In crab aquaculture, various types of feeds are employed to meet the nutritional needs of different
                    crab species and stages of development. Formulated pellets containing a balanced mix of proteins,
                    carbohydrates, fats, and nutrients are a convenient choice, while carnivorous species may be fed
                    with fresh or frozen seafood like fish, shrimp, and clams. Omnivorous and herbivorous crabs benefit
                    from algae and plant-based feeds, such as microalgae and spirulina. Natural food sources like
                    plankton and detritus can also be utilized, particularly in extensive systems. Supplementary feeds,
                    gel diets for larvae, and fishery byproducts such as offal contribute to diverse feeding strategies.
                    The choice of feed depends on factors like species, growth stage, farming system, and availability
                    of ingredients. Regular monitoring and adjustment of feeding regimes are vital to ensure proper
                    nutrition, growth, and overall health of farmed crabs.</p>
