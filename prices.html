                In the realm of aquaculture, pricing plays a pivotal role in the sustainable <br>cultivation of
                prawns,
                fishes, and crabs. The intricate balance of factors such as feed costs, water quality management,
                and
                disease control significantly influences the final pricing. Prawns, sought after for their exquisite
                taste, often command a premium due to careful breeding and specialized facilities. Fishes, diverse
                in
                species and market demand, are priced based on growth rates, environmental impact, and market
                trends.
                Meanwhile, the pricing of crabs hinges on factors like habitat simulation and quality of
                cultivation.
                Ultimately, setting prices in aquaculture necessitates a delicate consideration of production costs,
                market dynamics, and consumer preferences for a thriving industry.

            <h2>Prices of fish</h2>
            <p>Fish farming involves a dynamic cycle of growth and harvest, typically occurring every 6 to 12
                months.
                Fish, being a staple in many diets, enjoy substantial demand both locally and internationally, often
                leading to significant exports. This demand-driven market exerts upward pressure on fish prices per
                kilogram, aligning with their popularity. The pricing model considers factors like size and species
                (count) per kilogram, allowing for adjustments in line with market dynamics. These prices remain
                fluid,
                adapting to shifts in consumer preferences and market trends. Reference tables provide average
                values,
                offering insights into the pricing landscape. Just as in the prawn industry, the fish market's
                adaptability and sensitivity to demand make prices an ever-evolving aspect of the aquaculture
                industry.
                <br> So the prices will be like :
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Rahu(Andhra)</li>- Rs 22000 / Quintal
                <li>Katla(Big)</li>- Rs 30000 / Quintal
                <li>Bata Putti</li>- Rs 11000 / Quintal

            <h2>Prices of crabs:</h2>
            <p>Crab harvests typically occur every 3 to 4 months, contributing to a consistent supply in the market.
                With a strong demand both domestically and for international export, crabs stand as a valuable
                seafood
                commodity. The pricing of crabs is notably influenced by their size and weight, determining the
                number
                of crabs per kilogram. This approach ensures flexible pricing, where larger crabs command a higher
                price
                due to their meatier yield. The dynamic nature of the market leads to fluctuations in crab prices,
                driven by consumer preferences and seasonal variations. Tabled average prices provide an overview,
                but
                it's important to acknowledge that the crab market's fluidity necessitates frequent price
                adjustments to
                remain competitive and responsive to changing demands. <br> So the prices will be like : <br>
                <strong>The retail price range in Indian Rupee for crab is between INR 207.13 and INR 579.95 per
                    kilogram or between INR 93.93 and INR 263.02 per pound(lb)</strong>
