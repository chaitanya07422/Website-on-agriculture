        <p>Diseases are a significant concern in aquaculture operations, impacting the health and productivity of
            aquatic organisms. These diseases can lead to economic losses and environmental concerns. Factors such as
            high stocking densities, poor water quality, stress, and introduction of pathogens can contribute to disease
            outbreaks. Effective disease management practices are crucial to maintaining the sustainability of
            aquaculture systems. Monitoring, biosecurity measures, vaccination, and proper husbandry techniques are
            important strategies to mitigate disease risks and ensure the overall well-being of cultured species.</p>

        <h2>Some of the common diseases in shrimps:</h2>
        <div class="vibrio">
            <div class="content">
                <h3>1.Vibrio</h3>
                <p>Bacterial infections of farmed shrimp are quite common and likely the major cause of mortality in
                    farmed shrimp. Vibriosis is one of the most severe bacterial diseases in shrimp farming caused
                    by Vibrio spp. These bacteria from part of the natural microbiota of wild and cultured shrimp
                    and the marine environments. Vibrio infections have become a major constraint of the production
                    and trade in shrimp aquaculture. They are responsible for several diseases and mortalities of up
                    to 100% and cause crop loses globally.
                    Vibrio usually associated with multiple etiological agents. Vibrio has been reported in penaeid
                    shrimp culture systems implicating at least 14 species and they are Vibrio harveyi, V.
                    splendidus, V. parahaemolyticus,V. alginolyticus, V. anguillarum, V. vulnificus, V. campbelli,
                    V. fischeri, V.damsella, V. pelagicus, V. orientalis, V. ordalii, V. mediterrani, V. logei etc.
                    However some Vibrio species have been identified as primary pathogen, including V.
                    parahaemolyticus and V. harveyi have been described as the main pathogenic species in shrimp.
                </p>
                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                <p>Vibrios are difficult to eradicate because they adopt well to different environment conditions
                    and can adopt state when facing adverse conditions. However, Vibriosis is controlled by rigorous
                    water management and sanitation to prevent the entry of vibrios in the culture water and to
                    reduce stress on the shrimps. Pond Management and robust gut health are important strategies to
                    control vibrio, together with frequent sampling to monitor their levels in the shrimp gut and
                    pond ecosystem.
                    Good site selection, pond design and pond preparation are also important. Maintain adequate
                    water quality with low bacterial biomass, A stable phytoplankton bloom and a proper feeding
                    program, Sterilize or filter recirculated water, Routinely monitor shrimp and pond for early
                    diagnosis of a problem, Avoid temperature extremes or rapid variation in temperature, handling,
                    overcrowding, and other stressors, Infections opportunistic and probably result from poor
                    husbandry; may be secondary to other disease processes. An increase in daily water exchanges and
                    a reduction in pond biomass by partial harvesting are recommended to reduce mortalities caused
                    by vibriosis.</p>

                <h3>2.White spot disease (WSD) </h3>
                <p>White spot disease
                    (WSD) is a serious disease
                    of farmed shrimp globally.
                    The disease is transmitted
                    vertically from infected
                    brood stock to lar vae
                    and horizontally either
                    by ingestion of infected
                    organisms or through
                    carrier organisms. Most
                    crustaceans including all penaeid shrimps (monodon, vannamei,
                    indicus etc.) and crabs can be affected by WSD. All the life stages
                    of shrimp may get infected by this virus. Affected shrimp exhibit
                    anorexia, lethargy, reddish discoloration and presence of circular
                    white spots on the carapace and other exoskeletal parts. In Pacific
                    white shrimp, or vannamei shrimp, white spots may not be clearly
                    visible. Mortality of shrimp may start 2-3 days after infection and
                    reach 80-90 per cent within 5-7 days of onset of first mortalities,
                    necessitating emergency harvest.

                </p>
                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                <p>WSSV can persist in wet soil. Carry out pond preparation properly
                    by drying, applying lime etc. Provide sufficient time of at least
                    three to four weeks between the culture cycles to enable the
                    pond soil to completely dry.
                    Stock only post larvae (PL) of at least PL15 stage. Select healthy
                    PL using stress tests and make sure that the PL are negative for
                    WSSV by PCR testing.
                    Adopt strict biosecurity
                    measures by providing
                    reservoir ponds, bird
                    and crab fencing, proper
                    sanitationofmen ,
                    material and machines.
                    Adopt best management practice (BMP) to maintain good water
                    quality, proper feed usages and good health of shrimps through
                    regular monitoring.
                    Usages of probiotics and immunostimulant may be helpful.
                    However, avoid using too many chemicals / unauthorised
                    products without knowing their exact effect.</p>

                <h3>3.White feces disease (WFD) </h3>
                <p>White feces disease is one of the most serious problems in shrimp culture. It causes lower
                    productivity in shrimp farming. WFD becomes apparent when the digestive system of shrimp
                    malfunctions and feces turns from normal brownish color to pale white color. WFD has caused
                    significant economic losses to shrimp farmers, because of high FCR, slow growth, and variable sizes
                    of shrimp at harvest. White feces syndrome usually occurs after 60 days of culture (DOC) and it may
                    be accompanied by high shrimp mortality. The disease can cause moderate to severe economic loss by
                    reducing shrimp survival by 20â€“30 percent.Poor water quality, unhealthy seed, high vibrio loads,
                    Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei (EHP), and the Presence of Protozoa gregarines-like organisms in the
                    intestine and hepatopancreas are some of the reasons for causes of the disease.
                </p>
                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                <p>Pay attention to abnormal increase or decrease in feed uptake and verify the condition of shrimp
                    through microscopic examination.
                    Be cautious in feeding; increase or decrease according to the situation.Use Grobest functional feed.
                    Before expected environmental stress, preventive feeding is carried out to reduce the chance of
                    white feces.Improve waste discharge capacity to avoid water quality deterioration.
                    Add probiotics to the water to prevent proliferation of pathogenic bacteria and to improve waste
                    degradation.
                    Refrain from overusing medications, as they may lead to hepatopancreatic damage.Use disease-free
                    post-larvae.When white feces are first discovered and the shrimp still ingest, use Grobest
                    functional feed immediately till the white feces disappear.
                    Remove dead shrimp, leftover feed, fecal matter and other waste daily to avoid cross infection.
                    Use high-quality pathogen-free post-larvae.</p>

                <h3>1.Ichthyophthirius multifiliis (Ich or White Spot Disease)</h3>
                <p>Ichthyophthirius multifiliis, commonly known as Ich or White Spot Disease, is a highly contagious
                    parasitic infection affecting fish in aquaculture.
                    Infected fish develop white spots resembling grains of salt on their bodies, leading to skin
                    irritation, respiratory distress, and sometimes death.
                    Preventive measures include maintaining optimal water quality by monitoring temperature, pH, and
                    ammonia levels, and implementing a quarantine period for new fish.
                    Proper nutrition and avoiding overfeeding help strengthen fish immunity, reducing their
                    susceptibility to infections like Ich.
                    UV sterilizers can be employed to control the parasite in water, and careful temperature management
                    can accelerate the parasite's life cycle for better treatment effectiveness.
                    By implementing these preventive measures, aquaculturists can reduce the risk of Ich outbreaks and
                    maintain the overall health of their fish populations.
                </p>
                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                <p><strong>Maintain Good Water Quality:</strong> Regularly monitor and maintain water parameters such as
                    temperature, pH, ammonia, and nitrite levels. <br>
                    <strong>Quarantine New Fish:</strong> Isolate and observe new fish for signs of disease before
                    introducing them to the main tank. <br>
                    <strong>Proper Nutrition:</strong> Provide a balanced diet to boost the immune system of fish. <br>
                    <strong>Avoid Overcrowding:</strong> Adequate space reduces stress and the risk of disease
                    transmission. <br>
                    <strong>Use UV Sterilizers:</strong> UV sterilizers can help control parasites in the water. <br>
                    <strong>Temperature Management:</strong> Increasing the water temperature slightly can accelerate
                    the life cycle of the parasite, making it vulnerable to treatment.

                <h3>2.Aeromonas and Pseudomonas Bacterial Infections</h3>
                <p>Aeromonas and Pseudomonas are common bacterial pathogens responsible for infections in fish
                    aquaculture, causing fin and tail rot, ulcers, and pop-eye.
                    These infections often result from poor water quality, stress, or wounds, leading to compromised
                    fish health and increased mortality.
                    To prevent bacterial infections, new fish should be quarantined and equipment disinfected before
                    introduction, while maintaining proper hygiene and water quality.
                    Minimizing stress through gradual changes in environment, water quality, and handling helps bolster
                    fish immunity and reduce susceptibility to infections.
                    A balanced diet and immune-boosting supplements contribute to better immune health, while promptly
                    treating any wounds helps prevent bacterial entry points.
                    Practicing these preventive measures aids in maintaining a disease-resistant environment, improving
                    fish well-being, and reducing the impact of bacterial infections in aquaculture settings.
                </p>
                <h3>Prevention</h3>
                <p><strong>Quarantine and Disinfect:</strong> Isolate new fish and disinfect new equipment before
                    introducing them to existing tanks. <br>
                    <strong>Maintain Good Hygiene:</strong> Clean tanks, nets, and equipment regularly to prevent
                    bacterial buildup. <br>
                    <strong>Optimal Water Quality:</strong> Keep water parameters stable and within appropriate ranges.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Stress Reduction:</strong> Minimize stress by avoiding sudden changes in environment, water
                    quality, and handling.
                    <strong>Avoid Overfeeding:</strong> Excess food can contribute to poor water quality and stress.
                    <br>
                    <strong>Improve Immune Health:</strong> Provide proper nutrition and consider using immune-boosting
                    supplements. <br>
