                Aquaculture, also known as aquafarming, is the controlled
                cultivation ("farming") of aquatic organisms such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, algae and other
                organisms of value such as aquatic plants (e.g. lotus). Aquaculture involves cultivating freshwater,
                brackish water and saltwater populations under controlled or semi-natural conditions, and can be
                contrasted with commercial fishing, which is the harvesting of wild fish. Mariculture, commonly known
                as marine farming, refers specifically to aquaculture practiced in seawater habitats and lagoons, as
                opposed to freshwater aquaculture. Pisciculture is a type of aquaculture that consists of fish farming
                to obtain fish products as food. <br> <br>
                Main in aqua culture we have 3 different types :

            <h1><u>Prawns (shrimps)</u></h1>
            <p class="prawn_para">Prawns are aquatic crustaceans that play a significant role in aquaculture. They are
                commonly farmed for their culinary value and economic importance. Prawns belong to the larger group of
                decapod crustaceans, which includes shrimps. There are numerous species of prawns, each with distinct
                characteristics and requirements for aquaculture. Some of the notable prawn species cultivated include
                Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), black tiger shrimp (Penaeus monodon), and freshwater prawns
                (Macrobrachium spp). The choice of species depends on factors like market demand, environmental
                conditions, and suitability for farming practices. <br> Here is the detailed explaination about those
                types</p>

                    <p class="para1">
                        The Pacific white shrimp (Litopenaeus vannamei), commonly referred to as vannamei shrimp, is a
                        widely cultivated species in aquaculture due to its rapid growth rate, adaptability to various
                        environmental conditions, and global demand. Vannamei shrimp farming often involves the use of
                        intensive systems such as ponds and tanks, where water quality parameters are carefully
                        monitored and controlled. These shrimp are known for their light coloration and relatively
                        smaller size compared to other species. They are primarily fed with specially formulated diets
                        that provide essential nutrients for their growth and health. Disease management is of paramount
                        importance in vannamei shrimp aquaculture, as they can be susceptible to viral infections.
                        Strict biosecurity measures, proper quarantine practices, and careful monitoring are essential
                        to prevent and mitigate disease outbreaks. The success of vannamei shrimp farming lies in
                        understanding their biological requirements, optimizing culture conditions, and implementing
                        effective management practices to ensure sustainable production and contribute to the seafood
                        industry.

                        Black tiger prawn (Penaeus monodon), also known as tiger shrimp, is a prominent species in
                        aquaculture due to its commercial value and popularity in international markets. Tiger prawns
                        are typically farmed in brackish water or marine environments using various aquaculture systems
                        such as ponds, raceways, and cages. Known for their distinctive black stripes and larger size,
                        these prawns require careful management of water quality parameters, including temperature,
                        salinity, and dissolved oxygen levels. Feeding practices involve providing formulated diets that
                        meet their nutritional requirements for optimal growth and development. Disease management is a
                        crucial aspect of tiger prawn aquaculture, as they can be susceptible to various infections.
                        Regular health monitoring, biosecurity measures, and proper pond preparation contribute to
                        preventing disease outbreaks. Successful black tiger prawn farming combines knowledge of their
                        biology, environmental requirements, and effective husbandry practices to ensure sustainable
                        production and meet the demand for this sought-after seafood.
